2020-07-08T01:48:15Z,PC,655231498,seanpmorgan,Thanks @WindQAQ!     Just wanted to add a note that per discussion there is an upcoming RFC for adding custom op kernels alongside python composite ops. Once that is made public a future PR can add those since they've been requested in the migration RFC.    @alextp Is there a need for an advanced activation layer? What is the criteria for those?  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.2/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/advanced_activations.py,https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/41178#issuecomment-655231498,,,,Conventional review,Comment,Review,Question,SWEBOK-Software engineering management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Got it. Let alone the speed  two versions of gelu (approximate or not) produce different values. In my opinion  because the existing BERT-like models use the approximation version  if we change it to non-approximation by default  it will somehow loss some precision in the pretrained models.    https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UK47XgQgAWzvG4PwCk1jNI8VAIm0AQEL?usp=sharing,https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/41178#issuecomment-658989172,,,,Conventional review,Comment,other ,Code review,SWEBOK-Software engineering management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020-10-20T19:57:55Z,PC,713103587,allenlavoie,"One challenge with the custom device approach is that they're currently mutually exclusive with physical devices (an op is either on a physical device or a custom device). So if we're thinking of something that filters through every eager operation and is turned on globally then the custom device approach seems challenging for anything other than prototyping.    The op handler RFC proposes an updated version of that mechanism which isn't mutually exclusive with physical devices  and there I could see a global composite op lowering handler working. But even once that's implemented  it being useful is blocked on Python migrating to the eager/graph agnostic C API (see ""risks"" in the proposal).
