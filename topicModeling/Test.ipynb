      "One challenge with the custom device approach is that they're currently mutually exclusive with physical devices (an op is either on a physical device or a custom device). So if we're thinking of something that filters through every eager operation and is turned on globally then the custom device approach seems challenging for anything other than prototyping.    The op handler RFC proposes an updated version of that mechanism which isn't mutually exclusive with physical devices  and there I could see a global composite op lowering handler working. But even once that's implemented  it being useful is blocked on Python migrating to the eager/graph agnostic C API (see \"risks\" in the proposal). I don't expect it to be implemented quickly.\n",
